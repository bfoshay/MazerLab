```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
*Adding packages*

```{r}
library(data.table) # Efficient, succinct tools to wrangle data
library(visreg) # Tools to graph output of linear models
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
```



```{r}
ACdata<- read.csv("ACseedweight.csv")
view(ACdata)
```

```{r}
summary(lm(seedDOY ~ meanseedweight, ACdata))
mod1 <- lm(seedDOY ~ meanseedweight, data=ACdata)

ggplot(ACdata, aes(x=seedDOY, y=meanseedweight)) + geom_point()  + theme_classic() + xlab("Seed Collection Date") + ylab("Mean Seed Weight")

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
